Well, she got her daddy's car
And she cruised through the hamburger stand now
Seems she forgot all about the library
Like she told her old man now
And with the radio blasting
Goes cruising just as fast as she can now

And she'll have fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away

Well, the girls can't stand her
'Cause she walks, looks and drives like an ace now
She makes the Indy 500 look
Like a Roman chariot race now
A lotta guys try to catch her
But she leads them on a wild goose chase now

And she'll have fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away)

Well, she's making a turn
And it looks like she's coming around now
(Comin' around now, she's comin' around)
And I'm a little concerned
'Cause the town is closing on down now
(Town is closing on down now, town is closing on down)

Well, I jump in the 'Bird
For some good-time getting around now
(Getting around now, getting around now)

And we'll have fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away)
Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun 'til her daddy takes the T-bird away)

Well, you knew all along that
Your dad was gettin' wise to you now
(You shouldn't have lied, now you shouldn't have lied)
And since he took your set of keys
You've been thinking that your fun is all through now
(You shouldn't have lied, now you shouldn't have lied)

But you can come along with me
'Cause we gotta a lot of things to do now
(You shouldn't have lied, now you shouldn't have lied)

And you'll have fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away)
And you'll have fun fun fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
(Fun, fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away)

Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away

Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away

Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
Fun, fun now that daddy took the T-bird away
